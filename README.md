# Game Project (Game-proj)
A small project to learn Go, coming from a couple of years of (mostly analytic/scientific) Python experience. With learning Go as a priority, the number of external libraries are kept to a minimum, but libraries to deal with audio and graphic drivers are accepted.

Currently, the 'engine' has support for sprites, colliders, scenes, gamestates/global flags, rudimentary text, audio, and input actions.

The very basic beginnings of some features are in place such as characters, as they appear in most games (sprites, colliders, and movement), and a camera system. These would be next on the imaginary TO-DO list. Smaller known issues would be things like creating a complete build script, and completely separating the game engine logic from the game logic.

Progress paused as of (3/29/2025)
