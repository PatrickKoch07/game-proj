# Game Project (Game-proj)
A small project to learn Go, coming from a couple of years of (mostly analytic/scientific) Python experience. With learning Go as a priority, the number of external libraries are kept to a minimum, but libraries to deal with audio and graphic drivers are accepted. This project also ended up serving as a nice reminder of how to use OpenGL through glfw.

The main 'final' goal would be a 2-D sprite game with working levels, sound, saving, npc AI (in the classical game-sense), and dialogue trees. Although, a somewhat nice gameplay experience would be hoped for.
